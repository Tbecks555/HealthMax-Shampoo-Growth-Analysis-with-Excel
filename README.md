# HealthMax-Growth-Analysis-with-Excel

# Overview

In this project, I worked as a **Category Manager for HealthMax**, an FMCG company in the shampoo business. The analysis was performed entirely in **Excel** and focused on applying **Category Management and Net Revenue Management (NRM)** techniques to uncover growth opportunities, optimize pricing strategies, and improve profitability.

The analysis involved:

* Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **market share, value growth, YTD (Year-to-Date), and MAT (Moving Annual Total)**.

* Exploring **Brand Portfolio Pricing** and **Mix Management** to determine the right product mix and pricing strategy for new product launches.

* Applying **Trade Terms Management, Pack Price Architecture, and Promotion Management** to identify the most profitable investments and effective promotions.

* Developing a **growth forecast model** that combines organic growth with incremental revenue from NRM initiatives.


# Project Objectives

1. Calculate and analyze KPIs (market share, YTD, MAT) to assess category growth.

2. Apply Brand Portfolio Pricing and Mix Management to support product launches and category expansion.

3. Use Trade Terms, Pack Price Architecture, and Promotion Management to guide commercial strategy and investment decisions.

4. Forecast next year’s revenue growth by integrating organic growth with NRM-driven opportunities.


# Tools Used

* **Excel**: Performed KPI calculations (Market Share, YTD, MAT), applied Net Revenue Management techniques (Brand Portfolio Pricing, Mix Management, Trade Terms, Pack Price Architecture, Promotion Management), and built a growth forecast model.

* **PowerPoint**: Presented key findings, insights, and strategic recommendations for HealthMax’s management team.


# Key Insights

1. HealthMax supplies two shampoo brands — Shinez and Starbust, and the strongest growth came in 2020 (+4%) with Shinez driving most of it (+7.66%) compared to Starbust (+1.77%), showing that Shinez is the clear growth engine.

2. The total turnover of the shampoo category in the last 12 months (as of March 2023) was $98.45M, which means that even a small share gain can translate into millions in extra revenue.

3. Starbust held 24% market share in 2018 and dropped to 20% in 2023, while Shinez held 12% in 2018 and grew to 14% in 2023. Though Starbust led with 20% market share compared to Shinez’s 14%, Starbust is bigger but losing ground while Shinez is smaller but growing steadily.

4. In 2022, Net Sales were $20.48M with a Gross Profit of $14.03M and a Gross Margin of 68.5%, showing that the portfolio is highly profitable but requires smart pricing to sustain margins.

5. Starbust Ultra Soft 100ML is the most important SKU, with the highest gross margin (71%) and 18% of net sales contribution, making it a top strategic priority.

6. The Starbust Strong Hair range is the least important in terms of profitability and contribution, suggesting it may need repositioning or reformulation.


# NRM Growth Opportunities

We discovered that HealthMax is currently active in only **2 out of the 5 shampoo subcategories** (Anti-dandruff and Volumizing), leaving significant room to expand. By applying Net Revenue Management (NRM) growth strategies — specifically **Mix Management**, which focuses on optimizing the range of products across brands and subcategories — we identified opportunities to launch new products in untapped subcategories as a first step toward unlocking additional growth.

1. The **Organic shampoo category** recorded the fastest growth between 2018 and 2022, with sales increasing by approximately **276%** over the period. Looking at the historic trend, we estimate that the size of this category for full year 2024 will be **20% higher than the March 2023 MAT values**, reaching **1,020,899 units sold**. This shows that entering the Organic category presents a major opportunity for HealthMax Management to capture new consumer demand and strengthen long-term growth.

2. Based on the discovery that the Organic shampoo category is the fastest-growing segment, HealthMax Management evaluated two possible product launches for early 2024. We estimated the **expected Net Sales, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin** for both options to determine the best candidate. The analysis showed that **Herbashine should be launched**. While **HerbEssentials** is projected to generate slightly higher Net Sales (**$357,315**) compared to **Herbashine** (**$336,897**), Herbashine delivers a stronger **Gross Profit of $226,640** versus **$219,493** for HerbEssentials, and a higher **Gross Margin (67% vs. 61%)**. This makes Herbashine the more profitable and strategic choice for entering the Organic category.  

3. We applied another NRM strategy, **Price Pack Architecture (PPA)**, which focuses on designing the right pack sizes to meet different consumer needs. The smallest shampoo size in HealthMax’s portfolio was **100ml**. However, market research revealed growing demand among travelers for more compact **50ml bottles**. After analyzing the potential and benchmarking with international markets where 50ml formats had already proven successful, we estimated that launching a **50ml shampoo bottle** could open up a new consumer segment and generate approximately **$265,960 in Net Sales**. This shows that introducing smaller pack sizes not only addresses unmet consumer needs but also creates an incremental growth opportunity for HealthMax Management.

4. We also applied the **Promotion Management** strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns run on the **Shinez brand** in 2022. The goal was to identify which promotion should be prioritized for 2024.  

The analysis revealed clear differences in performance:  
- **Promotion #1 (Buy 2, Get 1 Free)**: –2% ROI, showing it was unprofitable.  
- **Promotion #2 (Buy 2, Get 20% Off)**: 12% ROI, making it the most effective promotion.  
- **Promotion #3 (2nd at 50% Off)**: 6% ROI, which delivered positive but moderate returns.  

This shows that **Promotion #2** was the most successful strategy, driving the highest return on investment and proving to be the best option for future campaigns.


# Impact of NRM Growth Strategies  

We presented the impact of the NRM growth initiatives on the company’s net sales of 2024 to the management using a Waterfall chart.  

- Without NRM initiatives, HealthMax’s forecasted **2024 net sales** would be **$20,808,712**, based on the historic market sales trend up to 2022.  
- With the identified NRM opportunities (Mix Management, Price Pack Architecture, and Promotion Management), the forecasted **2024 net sales** rise to **$21,411,569**.  

This implies that implementing the NRM strategies could generate an **additional $602,857 in net sales**, showcasing the tangible value of applying structured revenue management approaches. It highlights that beyond simply following market trends, proactive portfolio expansion, pricing innovation, and effective promotions can significantly accelerate growth and profitability.

# Conclusion

This project showed how applying NRM strategies can unlock both growth and profitability for HealthMax. Entering the Organic shampoo category, launching a 50ml pack size, and prioritizing the most effective promotion could together boost 2024 net sales by over $600K.

To sustain this growth, HealthMax Management should focus on high-growth categories, tailor pack sizes to evolving consumer needs, and optimize promotions for maximum ROI. A structured NRM framework positions the company to stay competitive and capture long-term market opportunities.
