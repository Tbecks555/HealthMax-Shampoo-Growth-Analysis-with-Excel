# HealthMax-Shampoo-Growth-Analysis-with-Excel

# Overview

In this project, I worked as a **Category Manager for HealthMax**, an FMCG company in the shampoo business. The analysis was performed entirely in **Excel** and focused on applying **Category Management and Net Revenue Management (NRM)** techniques to uncover growth opportunities, optimize pricing strategies, and improve profitability.

The analysis involved:

* Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **market share, value growth, YTD (Year-to-Date), and MAT (Moving Annual Total)**.

* Exploring **Brand Portfolio Pricing** and **Mix Management** to determine the right product mix and pricing strategy for new product launches.

* Applying **Trade Terms Management, Pack Price Architecture, and Promotion Management** to identify the most profitable investments and effective promotions.

* Developing a **growth forecast model** that combines organic growth with incremental revenue from NRM initiatives.


# Project Objectives

1. Calculate and analyze KPIs (market share, YTD, MAT) to assess category growth.

2. Apply Brand Portfolio Pricing and Mix Management to support product launches and category expansion.

3. Use Trade Terms, Pack Price Architecture, and Promotion Management to guide commercial strategy and investment decisions.

4. Forecast next year’s revenue growth by integrating organic growth with NRM-driven opportunities.


# Tools Used

* **Excel**: Performed KPI calculations (Market Share, YTD, MAT), applied Net Revenue Management techniques (Brand Portfolio Pricing, Mix Management, Trade Terms, Pack Price Architecture, Promotion Management), and built a growth forecast model.

* **PowerPoint**: Presented key findings, insights, and strategic recommendations for HealthMax’s management team.
